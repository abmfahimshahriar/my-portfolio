  Title: "Hi, Iâ€™m Fahim. Nice to meet you.",
  Description: `I'm skilled in MEAN and MERN stack and have an active interest in web development and web technologies. 
  This interest in web development always pushes me to learn new things and apply them in applications. 
  What can be more efficient than putting your learning into developing real-life applications? 
  Therefore, though having a full-time job, I try to develop side projects where I can put my learning to work. 
  Though my strong forte in web development, I started my career as a trainee engineer at Huawei Technologies Bangladesh. 
  While working at Huawei I started learning web development and after some time I joined Secure Link Services AG 
  as a Front-end developer to engage myself in industry best practices in web application development. 
  Since then I have been an active web application developer and always try to keep up by learning, 
  with the current web technologies out there in the industry.`,
